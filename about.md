<p>Hello! I'm Jaclyn Pasquale, a graphic designer from Cleveland, Ohio. I am a recent transplant to Nashville, Tennessee. I currently reside in East Nashville, Tennessee's regional Hipster headquarters. I received my BFA from Columbus College of Art &amp; Design in Graphic Design and Advertising. After graduation I set out on a mission to sell the world things/make pretty stuff/get a job.  I've worked with La Senza, PetPeople, The United Methodist Church and at multitude of smaller freelance gigs. I decided that being a cog in the machine that is the marketing department wasn't for me, so I headed south. Now, I'm attending Nashville Software School to learn web development.  </p>
