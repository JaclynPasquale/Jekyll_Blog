Coding is hard, There's a million ways to break somthing and Syntax is one fickle bitch. The hardest part about coding and debugging is not giving in to the urge to throw up your hands, flick off your computer and walk away. Even more torrmenting is the hope that envitably gets crushed when your found solution doesn't work. That is the struggle that is doing most things but especially coding. 








Victories are so rare for me now that I celebrate even small wins like I won the superbowl. In coding and programming most of my fixes break something else. So you could imagine how pleasantly surprised I am when I can help another students problems.
