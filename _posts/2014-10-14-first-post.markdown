I’ve been in Nashville, Tennessee exactly two weeks and one day and nothing has been easy. In that time I have had a roommate drop out on me just hours before I arrived in Nashville. I’ve moved twice, had my car rear-ended, started school and been totally overwhelmed. So far nothing has gone smoothly or easily, but I’m still here, so that’s something. 

I was able to stay with another student from NSS and his girlfriend *and* their roommate *and* their dog *and* an old man. So it was not what I had planned for. I am a little beyond the stress of that moment, so I can now look back on it and say that I am glad and lucky to stay with people that have become my friends. 

Last weekend I moved to my new house in East Nashville, which has also had it’s fair share of problems and stress. We currently have no internet, no working washing machine and a few brown recluse spiders. I'm working on those issues, but I think the only way to deal with the spiders is to burn down the house. 

I started school on October 6th in what is an old office strip mall building but looks like an abandoned building in a zombie apocalypse that was looted. Sometimes when I walk past all the empty rooms and spider webs Iimagine that we are all hiding out in this building, coding and waiting for this whole thing to blow over. 

All that information was probably irrelevant to you, the reader. So I will tell you about my first week at NSS and what I have learned. 

In the first week and half I have learned how to use the command line and vim. These things are pretty foreign to me. I’m not used to directly talking with my computer, I usually communicate with it through an interface and click on stuff until it does what I want. Setting up programs like Vim and connecting it to Github were way more labor intensive than I had thought. I am glad we used class time to set these things up, otherwise I would have been lost.

Our class has written some HTML and CSS to create a website. I am also not used to using CSS as most of my experience has been writing in archaic tables. We’ve jumped from topic to topic. We’ve worked with incorporating javascript into the website to create a login modal. We were introduced to Github and I am becoming more comfortable with using it.

Now we’re working on creating a blog using Jekyll and Markdown. I’m pretty impressed that I’m sort of retaining key commands and shortcuts. I’ve had a hard time with that mostly because adobe keyboard shortcuts are totally different. Command + S doesn’t save things in Vim, I didn’t know that. 

The first week or so has been overwhelming but I feel like I’ve learned a lot. There’s a never ending list of things I have to google and learn. I wish things had gone easier so it would have allowed me more time to prepare for class. Considering the circumstances, I’m just glad to have gotten this far and I have faith that things will start making sense.
